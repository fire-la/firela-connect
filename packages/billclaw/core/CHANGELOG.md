# Changelog

## 0.5.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix SKILL.md inconsistencies for OpenClaw security compliance.

  **Problem**: Security scan flagged two inconsistencies:

  1. Package name mismatch between SKILL.md and registry metadata
  2. Contradictory "No external code execution" statement

  **Changes**:

  1. Add @firela/billclaw-openclaw as primary (required) install entry
  2. Update Security Guarantee to clarify:
     - Skill provides installation instructions
     - Code execution handled by installed npm packages
     - All packages are transparent and auditable
  3. Add Package Overview section labeling required vs optional

  **Metadata updates**:

  - install[0]: @firela/billclaw-openclaw (required)
  - install[1]: @firela/billclaw-cli (optional)
  - install[2]: @firela/billclaw-connect (optional)

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix SKILL.md metadata format to match OpenClaw official standard.

  Change metadata from single-line JSON string to multi-line YAML
  nested JSON object format. This fixes ClawHub registry parsing issues
  where metadata (requires.env, install specs) was not properly recognized.

  **Before (single-line JSON):**

  ```yaml
  metadata: { "openclaw": { "requires": { "env": [...] } } }
  ```

  **After (multi-line YAML nested JSON):**

  ```yaml
  homepage: https://github.com/fire-la/billclaw
  metadata:
    {
      "openclaw":
        {
          "emoji": "💰",
          "requires": { "env": [...], "anyBins": [...] },
          "primaryEnv": "PLAID_CLIENT_ID",
          "install": [...],
        },
    }
  ```

  This matches the format used by official OpenClaw skills and ensures
  proper parsing by ClawHub registry.
